# React Jobs Project

### Description:
This project is a fully functional React-based CRUD web application that demonstrates the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of job listings. Built using React and Vite, the project utilizes modern React features such as hooks, state management, and routing to create an interactive single-page application (SPA). It integrates Tailwind CSS for styling, JSON Server for backend data, and various other React libraries to enhance functionality.

# React Job Listings CRUD Application

## Project Overview
This project is a fully functional React-based web application for managing job listings. It implements the complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, using modern React features such as hooks, state management, routing, and component-based architecture. The project is built using Vite for fast development, Tailwind CSS for styling, and JSON Server for backend data simulation.

## Features
- **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** operations for job listings
- **React Router** for navigation between pages
- **useState, useEffect, and useParams** hooks for state management and data fetching
- **Tailwind CSS** for fast and responsive UI design
- **Vite** for optimized development build
- **React Toastify** for notifications
- **React Icons** for scalable icons
- **JSON Server** for simulating a backend API

## Demo
The app demonstrates various functionalities like job listings, creating a new job, updating existing job data, deleting jobs, and more.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (JSX, Hooks), Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router
- **Backend:** JSON Server (Mock API)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Libraries:** React Toastify, React Icons

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- npm or yarn installed

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-crud-joblistings.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd react-crud-joblistings
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Run the JSON server:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

## File Structure
- **src/components** - Contains all React components like Navbar, JobListings, and Hero
- **src/pages** - Contains different route pages such as Homepage, Jobs Page, Single Job Page
- **src/App.jsx** - Main application component
- **src/styles** - Contains Tailwind CSS configuration

## Key Concepts Covered
1. **React State**: Manage component state with `useState` and `useEffect`.
2. **Hooks**: Utilize React hooks such as `useParams`, `useState`, `useEffect` to manage lifecycle and fetch data.
3. **JSX**: Create dynamic and reusable components using JSX.
4. **Routing**: Implement multi-page navigation with React Router.
5. **SPA vs SSR vs SSG**: Build a fast, modern single-page application (SPA).
6. **CRUD Operations**: Implement the full range of CRUD operations to handle job data.

## Available Scripts
- `npm run dev`: Start the development server
- `npm run build`: Build the app for production
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build
- `npm run server`: Start the JSON server
